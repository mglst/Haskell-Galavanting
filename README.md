# Constructing Numbers in a purely set theoretic way

## Natural Numbers

We have constructed the Natural numbers using the recursive definition of what numbers are. For example - in set theory - we think of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbb{N}"> to be set such that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0\=\{\}\=\emptyset \in \mathbb{N}"> and it is closed under the successor function, i.e if <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n \in \mathbb{N}"> then so does <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S(n) \in \mathbb{N}"> where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S"> is a successor function - you can essentially think of it as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n\+1 \in \mathbb{N}"> .
